# book-sentiment
Look at the sentiment of a book from start to finish. I started this projected so that I can learn more about web scraping and NLP.

- Graph book sentiment (positivity, negativity) over the duration of a book
- Graph the sentiment at the chapter level, normalized to show general trends over each chapter
- Make a GIF showing the progression of positivity vs. negativity over the duration of a book (in development)
